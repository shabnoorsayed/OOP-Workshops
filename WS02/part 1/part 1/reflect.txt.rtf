\f0\fs24 \cf0 This workshop for me was a lot more easier for me to work with in comparison to the first one surprisingly maybe because I was confused with the setup as it was a transition but now I think I have a hang of it and had a lot more time to work on my code and logics.\
I this workshop I learned about function overloading as we have multiple gifting function, also the parameters we pass in our function will be by the reference so the change stays outside of the function as well, other than that we learned about the global constants .\
Overalll I loved this workshop and i don\'92t have much challenges to highlight.}
