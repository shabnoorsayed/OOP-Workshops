\f0\fs28 \cf0 This workshop was super fun, I love how the course is designed, I used to find previous workshops a bit difficult but as I am further understanding I am find them easier.\
In this workshop I learned how to use constructor and destructor to set and unset values. Other then that my previous skills about working with classes and dynamic arrays were also polished, A constant member function cannot modify any non-static data members or call any member function that aren\'92t constant and In my case I am calling powerUp() function inside \cf2 \cb3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
