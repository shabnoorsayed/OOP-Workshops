\f0\fs24 \cf0 Workshop 3 part 1 was a bit tough and it took me longer then part 2 to complete because it was the time I was starting to figure out working with classes and objects and there use and I found that challenging. Things I learned in this workshop was how to properly copy values using strcpy and memcpy. Also in the first part when I tried submitting I had a memory leak so I also learned to read the output file and to understand what is exactly wrong with my code I did took help from internet to figure that out but now I do understand. I also googled how the I get rid of trailing zero of a number which I also mentioned on the top of part 1.}
