\f0\fs24 \cf0 This workshop was very challenging for the first workshop, we had so much to do, but the good part is that we did learned a lot and it helped me to brush up my IPC 144 skills.\
\
Things I learned in this workshop is this correct way of including header files and cpp files, other than that we also learned how to use multiple builtin functions like I used isdigit.\
\
I also learned that how can we write a modular code and increase the reusability of our code for future use, so the codes I have written in my Utsil I can use it anytime in future for my other workshops.   }
